API = An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. 
  Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical 
  user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. 
  A programmer then puts the blocks together.

External API = open APIs is an interface that has been designed to be easily accessible
  the wider population of the web and mobile developers. This means an open API may be 
  used both by developers inside the organization that published the API or by any developers 
  outside that organization who wish to register for access to the interface.

Internal API = A private API is an interface that opens parts of an organizationâ€™s backend data 
  and application functionality for use by developers working within (or contractors working for) 
  that organization. The new applications these devs create may be distributed publicly but the 
  interface itself is unavailable to anyone not working directly for the API publisher.

JSON = SON is short for JavaScript Object Notation, and is a way to store information in an organized, easy-to-access manner. 
  In a nutshell, it gives us a human-readable collection of data that we can access in a really logical manner.
  To access the information stored in a variable we stored in a JSON file, we can simply refer to the name of the property we need. 
  Many sites are sharing data using JSON in addition to RSS feeds nowadays, and with good reason: JSON feeds can be loaded asynchronously 
  much more easily than XML/RSS.

Pusher = is a hosted service that makes it super-easy to add real-time data and functionality 
  to web and mobile applications.  Pusher sits as a real-time layer between your servers and your clients. 
  Pusher maintains persistent connections to the clients - over WebSocket if possible and falling back to 
  HTTP-based connectivity - so that as soon as your servers have new data that they want to push to the 
  clients they can do, instantly via Pusher.
