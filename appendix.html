API = An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. 
  Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical 
  user interface (GUI) components. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. 
  A programmer then puts the blocks together.

External API = open APIs is an interface that has been designed to be easily accessible
  the wider population of the web and mobile developers. This means an open API may be 
  used both by developers inside the organization that published the API or by any developers 
  outside that organization who wish to register for access to the interface.

Internal API = A private API is an interface that opens parts of an organizationâ€™s backend data 
  and application functionality for use by developers working within (or contractors working for) 
  that organization. The new applications these devs create may be distributed publicly but the 
  interface itself is unavailable to anyone not working directly for the API publisher.
